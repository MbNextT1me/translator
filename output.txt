Once upon a time there was an old man with an old woman.
So the old man says to the old woman:
- Podi-ka, old woman, scrape through the box, mark the soucock, will you scrape the flour into a kolobok.
The old woman took a wing, scraped it through the box, swept it through the bottom and scraped the flour of a handful of two.
I kneaded the flour on sour cream, concocted the kolobok, fried it in oil and put it on the window.
Kolobok lay down, lay down, took yes and rolled - from window to bench, from bench to floor, floor to door, jumped over the threshold - yes in the canopy, from the canopy to the porch, from the porch to the yard, from the yard to the gate, further and further.
Kolobok rolls along the road, towards him hare:
- Kolobok, Kolobok, I'll rent you!
"Don't eat me, Hare, I'll sing you a song:

I'm Kolobok, Kolobok,
I'm a box scraper,
On the susek meten,
On sour cream meshon
Yes in the oil of the buckle,
There is a stuzhon on the window.
I left my grandfather,
I left my grandmother,
I'll leave you, hare!
